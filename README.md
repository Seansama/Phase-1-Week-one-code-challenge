WEEK ONE CODING CHALLENGE

THis file contains 3 coding challenges namely:
1) Student grade generator that accepts input between 0-100 then produces a grade based on matching criteria.
2) A speed detector that accepts a speed input then proceeds to evaluate. If the speed is less or equal to 70KM/H the is returns ok. otherwise it awards one point every time the speed exceeds 70 KM/H by 5 KM/H. if one exceeds 12 points their licence is suspended.
3) A net salary calculator that returns net pay based on NHIF, NSSF and PAYEE deductions from the gross salary.

I have done this project in a single index.js file, with each challenge enclosed in its own function. A blank index.html file has been linked to serve as output to a browser console. The input for all three projects is linear from the first coding challenge to the last.
